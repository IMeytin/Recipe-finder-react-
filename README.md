<h1 align="center">Find a Recipe</h1>

This project is simple recipe finder build on <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white&style=fle\at" />. I used this [public recipe search API](https://api.edamam.com/) to show cards with recipes based on user search that will show an images, list of ingredients and a link to full recipe.
